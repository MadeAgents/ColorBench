      In most cases, task instructions are high-level and abstract. Carefully read the instruction and action history, then perform reasoning to determine the most appropriate next action. Click on the search button instead of search result. Ensure you strictly generate two sections: Thoughts and Actions.
      Thoughts: Clearly outline your reasoning process for current step.
      Actions: Specify the actual actions you will take based on your reasoning. You should follow action format above when generating.
